  Rosemary Matthews is an emerging artist born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in
Tampa, Florida. She graduated from the University of Florida in 2023 with a B.F.A. in painting
and a certificate in graphic design.
  
  Rosemary’s paintings are the result of a lifelong pursuit in learning how to capture an
intangible feeling, such as the way the air feels right before it rains or the fleeting memories
right after waking up from a dream. In this way, her work has an almost cinematic feel to it,
toeing the lines between what we see and what we feel, what is real and what is projected onto
the real.
  
  Many of her paintings start as photographs that she takes daily while going about
everyday tasks, as part of an ongoing compulsion to record and immortalize the beauty of her
surroundings. This is reflected in her work as images of memories become skewed by a hyper-
saturated color palette and abstracted, occasionally cartoonish, visual imagery.
  
  Growing up in Florida has deeply influenced her painting practice and has led her to
develop a deep reverence for the swampy, temperamental, and unforgiving Florida landscape.
There is a palpable sense of wonder in her work that bubbles with an underlying fluorescent
paranoia, aligning with a distinctly Southern Gothic attitude. She is interested in the way
humans and nature interact within this densely humid, collective dreamscape they call Florida.
  
  In addition to painting the Floridian dreamscape, she also likes to insert her character,
the Bunny-Dog, into many of her paintings. The Bunny-Dog is visually characterized by its
cartoonishly long nose, ears, and tail, and varies in shape, size, and personality. It is a fickle
creature, understanding simultaneously the role of predator and prey, protector and protected.
For Rosemary, the Bunny-Dog is a symbol of the inherent wisdom of all earthly creatures, and
their ability to be silly and fun but also full of divine knowingness.
  
  Her painting heroes are scattered across art history, with her current most prominent
influences being the work of Georgia O’Keefe, Toyen, and Peter Doig. She dreams of one day
showing art alongside her contemporary painting heroes, which include artist such as Naudline
Pierre, Inka Essenhigh, and Rae Klein.
